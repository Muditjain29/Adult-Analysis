💼 Employee Salary Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of employee salary data to understand the key factors influencing salary variations and to build predictive models that estimate employee salaries based on various features.

📌 Project Overview
Objective: Analyze employee data to explore salary trends and predict future salaries

Dataset: Contains employee attributes such as age, experience, department, job role, education level, and salary

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

📊 Key Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered trends and patterns in salaries across departments, roles, and experience levels

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and normalized categorical features

Feature Engineering: Created new variables to improve model accuracy

Model Building: Trained multiple machine learning models including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Model Evaluation: Compared models using metrics like R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
