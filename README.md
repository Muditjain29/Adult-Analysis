ðŸ§  Adult Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing the Adult Income dataset, often used for predicting whether an individual earns more than $50K/year based on demographic features such as age, education, occupation, and more. The objective was to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Python to gain insights and make accurate predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
